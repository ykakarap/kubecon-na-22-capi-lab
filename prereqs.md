## Linux

### Install Docker, kubectl, kind and clusterctl

Install Docker as documented on the Docker website. You can choose between:
* [Docker Engine (e.g. Ubuntu)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (preferred)
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

Verify the Docker installation via:
```bash
docker version
docker ps
```

**Note**: If you are using Docker Desktop please ensure the Docker VM has at least 4 CPU, 10 GB RAM and 32 GB disk.

Install kubectl as documented in [Install and Set Up kubectl on Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

Verify kubectl via:
```bash
kubectl version --client -o yaml
```

Install kind v0.16.0 by downloading it from the [kind release page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.16.0) and adding it to the path.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/download/v0.16.0/kind-linux-amd64 -o /tmp/kind
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 /tmp/kind /usr/local/bin/kind

# Verify via:
kind version
```

Install clusterctl v1.2.3 by downloading it from the [ClusterAPI release page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/tag/v1.2.3) and adding it to the path.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/download/v1.2.3/clusterctl-linux-amd64 -o /tmp/clusterctl
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 /tmp/clusterctl /usr/local/bin/clusterctl

# Verify via:
clusterctl version
```

### Clone the tutorial repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ykakarap/kubecon-na-22-capi-lab
cd kubecon-na-22-capi-lab

# Export the CLUSTERCTL_REPOSITORY_PATH environment variable
# it will be required later to run the tutorial offline
export CLUSTERCTL_REPOSITORY_PATH=$(pwd)/clusterctl/repository
```

**Note**: You can also download the repository via this link if you don't have `git` installed: [main.zip](https://github.com/ykakarap/kubecon-na-22-capi-lab/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

### Pre-download container images

As we don't want to rely on the conference WiFi please pre-pull the container images used in the tutorial via:

```bash
sh ./scripts/prepull-images.sh
```

### Verification

This section describes steps to verify everything has been installed correctly.

Create the kind cluster: (including pre-loading images)
```bash
sh ./scripts/create-kind-cluster.sh
```

Should return:
```bash
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.25.2) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Not sure what to do next? 😅  Check out https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
```

Test kubectl:
```bash
kubectl get node

```bash
.\scripts\prepull-images.ps1
```

**Note** You might have to enable running scripts by executing `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` in a PowerShell run as Administrator.

### Verification

This section describes steps to verify everything has been installed correctly.

Create the kind cluster: (including pre-loading images)
```bash
.\scripts\create-kind-cluster.ps1

## Avoid GitHub rate-limiting when running the tutorial without the local clusterctl repository

**Note**: The tutorial uses a local clusterctl repository, so these steps are not required to run the tutorial,
they are just documented in case folks want to run the tutorial without the local repository.

clusterctl accesses GitHub to install Cluster API, to avoid rate-limiting please set up a GitHub token.

First, create a token as documented on the [GitHub website](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (no permissions needed)

Export the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment

Linux and macOS:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

Windows:
```bash
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "<GITHUB_TOKEN>"
```
